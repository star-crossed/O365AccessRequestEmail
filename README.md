# O365AccessRequestEmail
By default on SharePoint Online, the access request email for a new web gets set to the user who created that web. This may be fine for some organizations where a dedicated user is creating each new web and the same user will handle all access requests. For my organization, we wanted the access requests to be sent to an email address on our help desk application that generates a new ticket. Since we already had many webs in place, I decided to write a script to loop through all of the site collections and reset the email address for each web to our help desk email.
